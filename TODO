DONE:
- refactor names in SimulationCanvasController to be more descriptive

DOING:
- extract responsibility to ProjectionMatrix class

TODO:

TODO: remove the iterator2D because it's unnecessary - the Node contains position information
    so it's unnecessary to output position separately

TODO: extract drawing class from SimulationCanvasController - this class is too big and has too many responsibilities

TODO: create an array of references to logicGates on the board to facilitate moving the logic gates, without it it's hard to find
    which gate is clicked

TODO: create new faster Unbound2DList

TODO: Create a proxy for the Unbound2DList that returns empty objects instead of nulls OR rewrite Unbound2DList for it
