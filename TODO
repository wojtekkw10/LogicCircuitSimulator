DONE:
- refactor names in SimulationCanvasController to be more descriptive
- extract responsibility to ProjectionMatrix class (Projection2D)
- refactor DrawSquareLogicElementVisitor to avoid repetition
- extract drawing class from SimulationCanvasController - this class is too big and has too many responsibilities
-  remove unused function
- fix DrawingManager to depend less on the CanvasController (not using CanvasController.logicElementDragged)

DOING:


TODO:

TODO: create an array of references to logicGates on the board to facilitate moving the logic gates, without it it's hard to find
    which gate is clicked

TODO: create new faster Unbound2DList

TODO: divide ArrayWireGrid into two classes: 1. wire management (set Wire, getWire etc) 2. propagation

TODO: rename 2DList to Grid


NOT DONE:
- create a proxy for the Unbound2DList that returns empty objects instead of nulls OR rewrite Unbound2DList for it ||| Should just make ArrayWireGrid smaller
- remove the iterator2D because it's unnecessary - the Node contains position information
    so it's unnecessary to output position separately ||| Not done because we have this unbounded array of elements. We set and get them with vector2D
    but when we want to use iterator we lose that information.
